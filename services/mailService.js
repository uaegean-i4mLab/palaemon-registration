    <p>
      This is an automated verification email. <br/>
      Your affiliation with UAegean was successfully verified.
    </p>

    <p>
      You have successfully used yourID Card with UAegean to access the services of one of the UAegean myID Card Partner Service Providers, 
      the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/44barcoffeeshop/?hl=en">44 Coffee Shop</a> at Chios, Greece. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We hope you have enjoyed the experience of using your <b>Disposable UAegean Digital Credential</b> 
      to prove your ERASMUS status to “44 Coffee Shop”. The card you have used, guarantees the <b>absolute privacy of your personal data</b>:
      <ul>
        <li>The only thing that the use of your Card reveals to a Service Provider is the fact you are a real person and an ERASMUS+ student affiliated with UAegean.
            <b> Nothing else!</b> 
        </li>
        <li>
        In addition, yourID Card with UAegean will automatically disappear after the end of your journey with UAegean without leaving any trace of you behind. 
        </li>
      </ul> 
    </p>
    </div>

    <div>
     <p>
     We really thank you for the participation in this field experiment with the SEAL Digital Identity Credentials.
      These Credentials allow you to instantly authenticate with an <b>Online Service Provider</b> (with some help from your mobile phone), 
      or to reveal some part of your identity to a <b>physical store</b> (as you “almost” did today). 
      Whatever is the use case, you are prompted to <b>scan a QR code and instantly present the requested by the Service Provider identity attributes</b>. 
     </p>

     <p>
     In several cases, the information that will be requested from you to disclose, via yourID Card | UAegean, should be minimal. In some cases, like medical services, you will be requested to submit more personal information. In all these cases, what you disclose is in your hand, and  the process is <b>absolutely conditioned upon your consent and absolutely nothing can be shared without your explicit permission</b>. 
     </p>
     <p>
     We hope that this way of authentication/identification will prevail over current plethoric identification schemes (think about Facebook for example) which require from you to share much more about you than it is really needed (and additionally you might not be made privy to whom your information  is being shared with). On top of that, this new technology might also help us to get rid of the “old fashioned” usernames and passwords. Once and for all. 
     </p>   

      <p>
      To prove how “agnostic” your identification was, the 44 Coffee Shop could not know your email, it had to ask you to provide directly an email and a physical address (the address you want to reveal). Now, the University of the Aegean and the 44 Coffee Shop will forward to you, <b>in the address you have indicated</b>, a special gift, to express our gratitude for your participation in this experiment. 
      </p>
